- **CSRF Token Generation Issue**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Fixed CSRF token generation failure using comprehensive logging and systematic debugging
  - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for admin operations and security
  - **Root Cause**: CSRF middleware was not executing due to middleware order and authentication structure issues
  - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive logging throughout the system and restructured authentication middleware
  - **Technical Implementation**: Added extensive console.log statements to auth middleware, admin routes, and server startup, restructured auth middleware to use local sessions Map, moved CSRF token generation to individual route files after authentication, created comprehensive testing script for all 5 hypotheses
  - **Testing**: All 5 hypotheses tested simultaneously - Route Registration (PASSED), Middleware Execution Order (PASSED), Route Path Mismatch (PASSED), Authentication Blocking (PASSED), Express Router Configuration (PASSED)
  - **Result**: CSRF tokens now generated and sent in response headers, admin operations protected with CSRF validation
- **Staff Payment Data Clearing Recurrence**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED AGAIN - Same dual database issue occurred and was resolved using documented procedures
  - **Circumstances**: Staff roster payment data reappeared, causing same confusion as before
  - **Root Cause**: Multiple database files in different locations causing data inconsistency
  - **Solution**: Removed redundant database file and standardized on single database location
  - **Prevention**: Documented procedures to prevent future occurrences
- **Frontend/Backend Integration Issue**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Critical port mismatch and Nginx configuration problems fixed
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Frontend completely inaccessible due to port conflicts
  - **Root Cause**: Frontend trying to connect to port 3000 while backend running on port 3000, Nginx serving frontend files on port 80
  - **Solution**: Implemented Express.js static file serving for frontend files, eliminated separate frontend server, fixed Nginx proxy configuration
  - **Technical Implementation**: Added `app.use(express.static('web-app'))` to server.js, updated Nginx config to proxy only API calls, implemented SPA routing for frontend
  - **Result**: Frontend now accessible on standard HTTP port 80, no more port conflicts, complete integration achieved
- **Critical API Routing Middleware Order Issue**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Fixed critical bug causing all API calls to return HTML instead of JSON
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - All business functionality broken due to incorrect data types
  - **Root Cause**: Express.js middleware execution order causing API routes to return HTML content instead of JSON data
  - **Solution**: Corrected middleware order, moved static file serving after API routes, ensured proper route precedence
  - **Technical Implementation**: Reordered middleware in server.js, moved `app.use(express.static('web-app'))` after API route mounting, added comprehensive logging to verify middleware execution
  - **Testing**: Created automated test suite validating fix (6 tests passed), verified all API endpoints return JSON correctly
  - **Result**: All business functionality restored, API endpoints return correct data types, system fully operational
- **API_BASE_URL Issue**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Fixed `Uncaught ReferenceError: api is not defined` and `API_BASE_URL value: undefined`
  - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Login functionality completely broken
  - **Root Cause**: `window.api` assignment issue in api.js causing global API object to be undefined
  - **Solution**: Fixed `window.api = api` assignment to ensure global API object is properly defined
  - **Technical Implementation**: Corrected global object assignment in api.js, verified API_BASE_URL is properly set
  - **Result**: Login functionality restored, users can now successfully authenticate
