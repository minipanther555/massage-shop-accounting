# **PROJECT HANDOVER DOCUMENT - EIW MASSAGE SHOP BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM**

---

## **1. Core Project Brief**
- **Project Mission:** A comprehensive web-based bookkeeping and management system for a massage shop, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution that handles staff management, service tracking, financial reporting, and daily operations management.
- **Core Functionality:** Staff management with role-based access control, service catalog management with location-based pricing, transaction processing and financial reporting, multi-location support for 3-location chain operations.

## **2. Technical Architecture**
- **Architecture Pattern:** Layered Monolith with Node.js/Express backend, SQLite database, and vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend
- **Rationale:** Chosen for rapid development, simplicity of deployment, and ease of maintenance for a small business operation. The monolithic approach provides all functionality in a single application while maintaining clear separation of concerns.
