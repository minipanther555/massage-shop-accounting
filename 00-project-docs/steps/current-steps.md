1.  **[Test] Run final integration test for the transaction edit feature.**
    *   **Status**: âœ… `completed`
    *   **Priority**: CRITICAL
    *   **Required**: Execute the `tests/test_transaction_edit_integration_2024-08-24.js` script to provide final sign-off on the feature.
    *   **Notes**: Completed after a lengthy debugging session that uncovered and fixed multiple bugs, including a server startup crash, an SQL typo, and a critical server-side filtering logic error.

3.  **[Infra] Set up Sentry for the frontend.**
    *   **Status**: âœ… `completed`
    *   **Notes**: This task was significantly more complex than anticipated and uncovered multiple deep-seated issues that have now been resolved.
        *   **Static File Serving:** Implemented `express.static` middleware in `server.js` to correctly serve the `web-app` directory.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Performed multiple updates to the CSP in `security-headers.js` to allow Sentry's CDN scripts and data ingestion endpoints, including the critical `worker-src: blob:` directive required for the Session Replay feature.
        *   **DSN Mismatch:** The final root cause of the integration failure was the use of the backend Sentry project's DSN in the frontend code. This was corrected in `web-app/shared.js`.
        *   **Automated Testing:** Implemented a Playwright script (`diagnostics/sentry_verify_diag.js`) to provide automated, headless browser verification, which was essential for debugging the CSP and DSN issues.

4. **[Refactor] Clean up codebase.**
    *   **Status**: ðŸ”µ `next_up`
    *   **Priority**: High
    *   **Required**: Now that the major bug-fixing effort is complete, perform a targeted cleanup of the codebase. This includes removing dead code, ensuring consistent formatting, and addressing any new linting errors that were introduced.
