**Methodology**: Post-CSRF Regression Remediation FSM (Artifact-Gated Debugging State Machine)

### ✅ CSRF Testing Infrastructure - COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive CSRF testing infrastructure established

**What Was Implemented**:
1. **Jest Helper**: `tests/helpers/requestWithCsrf.js` - Automated CSRF token management for integration tests
2. **Playwright Helper**: `tests/e2e/helpers/authFlow.ts` - CSRF-aware requests for E2E tests
3. **Testing Contract**: `tests/CONTRACT.md` - Standardized testing patterns and requirements
4. **CSRF Guide**: `tests/CSRF.md` - Comprehensive CSRF testing documentation
5. **CI Grep Rules**: `ci-grep-rules.txt` - Automated contract enforcement

**Implementation Details**:
- **CSRF Flow**: GET /csrf → token + cookie → POST with X-CSRF-Token header
- **Automatic Management**: Helpers handle token fetching and attachment automatically
- **Standardized Pattern**: All tests use consistent CSRF handling approach
- **Contract Enforcement**: CI rules prevent forbidden patterns

### ✅ Test Suite Restoration - COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 52 integration tests now passing

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **C1 CSRF-Contract**: Tests now use `requestWithCsrf()` helper for protected endpoints
2. **C2 Harness Mismatch**: Standardized on live-server HTTP pattern, removed `supertest(app)` imports
3. **C3 E2E Placement**: Moved Playwright tests to `/tests/e2e`, updated Jest config
4. **C4 Module/Runner**: Replaced chai with Jest expect, fixed import paths
5. **C5 App Logic/Fixtures**: Fixed database schema mismatches and DOM selector issues

**Test Results**:

2. **Testing Pattern**: Forbid supertest(app) imports in integration tests
3. **CSRF Mode**: Forbid app.use(csurf()) without {cookie:...} configuration
4. **Test Structure**: Forbid Playwright tests in integration directory
5. **Credentials**: Forbid credentials: 'omit' for protected routes

**Prevention Measures**:
- **Standardized Helpers**: All tests use consistent CSRF handling
- **Testing Contract**: Clear documentation of required patterns
- **Automated Checks**: CI grep rules enforce compliance
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides prevent knowledge gaps

### ✅ Root Cause Analysis - COMPLETED

### Next Phase Testing Priorities
**Phase 12**: Multi-Location Authentication Implementation - Ready to start
**Dependencies**: ✅ All resolved - Test suite fully operational, CSRF contract enforced
**Status**: Ready for next phase development with robust testing infrastructure in place

## Phase 11: CSRF Regression Remediation & Test Suite Restoration ✅ COMPLETED

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Test Suite Fully Restored and CSRF Contract Enforced
**Date**: December 20, 2024
**Objective**: Resolve test suite regressions after CSRF contract change and establish CI gates to prevent future issues
**Methodology**: Post-CSRF Regression Remediation FSM (Artifact-Gated Debugging State Machine)

### ✅ CSRF Testing Infrastructure - COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive CSRF testing infrastructure established

**What Was Implemented**:
1. **Jest Helper**: `tests/helpers/requestWithCsrf.js` - Automated CSRF token management for integration tests
2. **Playwright Helper**: `tests/e2e/helpers/authFlow.ts` - CSRF-aware requests for E2E tests
3. **Testing Contract**: `tests/CONTRACT.md` - Standardized testing patterns and requirements
4. **CSRF Guide**: `tests/CSRF.md` - Comprehensive CSRF testing documentation
5. **CI Grep Rules**: `ci-grep-rules.txt` - Automated contract enforcement

**Implementation Details**:
- **CSRF Flow**: GET /csrf → token + cookie → POST with X-CSRF-Token header
- **Automatic Management**: Helpers handle token fetching and attachment automatically
- **Standardized Pattern**: All tests use consistent CSRF handling approach
- **Contract Enforcement**: CI rules prevent forbidden patterns

### ✅ Test Suite Restoration - COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All 52 integration tests now passing

**Issues Resolved**:
1. **C1 CSRF-Contract**: Tests now use `requestWithCsrf()` helper for protected endpoints
2. **C2 Harness Mismatch**: Standardized on live-server HTTP pattern, removed `supertest(app)` imports
3. **C3 E2E Placement**: Moved Playwright tests to `/tests/e2e`, updated Jest config
4. **C4 Module/Runner**: Replaced chai with Jest expect, fixed import paths
5. **C5 App Logic/Fixtures**: Fixed database schema mismatches and DOM selector issues

**Test Results**:
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: 14/14 suites passing, 52/52 tests passing
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: 1/1 suite passing (login CSRF flow verified)
- ✅ **Test Pattern**: Consistent live-server HTTP approach across all tests
- ✅ **CSRF Compliance**: All protected endpoint tests properly validate security contract

### ✅ CI Gates & Prevention - COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Automated regression prevention established

**Gates Installed**:
1. **CSRF Contract**: Forbid POST to /auth/* without X-CSRF-Token header
2. **Testing Pattern**: Forbid supertest(app) imports in integration tests
3. **CSRF Mode**: Forbid app.use(csurf()) without {cookie:...} configuration
4. **Test Structure**: Forbid Playwright tests in integration directory
5. **Credentials**: Forbid credentials: 'omit' for protected routes

**Prevention Measures**:
- **Standardized Helpers**: All tests use consistent CSRF handling
- **Testing Contract**: Clear documentation of required patterns
- **Automated Checks**: CI grep rules enforce compliance
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides prevent knowledge gaps

### ✅ Root Cause Analysis - COMPLETED
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Complete analysis documented

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Mixed CSRF Modes**: Tests were incompatible with new cookie-mode CSRF implementation
2. **Inconsistent Patterns**: Mixed testing approaches caused harness conflicts
3. **Missing Infrastructure**: No standardized helpers for CSRF-protected requests
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Lack of clear testing contract led to inconsistent implementations

**Resolution Strategy**:
- **Contract Reset**: Established single, consistent CSRF testing contract
- **Infrastructure Build**: Created standardized helpers for all test types
- **Pattern Normalization**: Standardized on live-server HTTP approach
- **Gate Installation**: Automated checks prevent future regressions

### Testing Results Summary
**Overall Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Test suite fully restored and secured
**Test Coverage**: 100% of integration tests passing with CSRF compliance
**Security Validation**: All protected endpoints properly tested with CSRF tokens
**Regression Prevention**: CI gates and standardized patterns prevent future issues
**Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and contracts ensure maintainability
