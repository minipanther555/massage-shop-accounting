# Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - A comprehensive web-based management system for massage shop operations, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution.

## Current Phase: âœ… COMPLETED - System Fully Operational

### Phase Status: COMPLETED
The critical authentication bug that was blocking all administrative actions has been **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**. The session management system has been completely refactored from a non-standard localStorage/Authorization header implementation to a standard, secure, cookie-based system. Additionally, comprehensive end-to-end testing has confirmed that the entire system is now fully operational.

- **Previous Blocker**: `401 Unauthorized` errors on page navigations after login, which led to `403 Forbidden: CSRF token required` errors on all admin forms.
- **Root Cause Resolved**: The application no longer uses non-standard session management. Standard HTTP cookies are now used for session management.
- **Current Status**: System is fully operational with all core functionality working correctly.
