# Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - A comprehensive web-based management system for massage shop operations, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution.

## Current Phase: ðŸ”´ STALLED - Resolving Critical CSRF Authentication Bug

### Phase Status: STALLED
The Production Deployment was successful, but a critical CSRF bug is preventing all administrative write-actions (e.g., adding staff, updating services), blocking core business functionality. The system is currently considered **STALLED** until this is resolved.

- **Current Blocker**: `403 Forbidden: CSRF token required` on all admin POST/PUT/DELETE requests.
- **Root Cause**: Nginx serves admin pages as static files, bypassing the backend middleware that generates the necessary CSRF token.
- **Resolution Plan**: Create new backend routes to serve protected admin pages, ensuring the CSRF middleware is executed.

- **Localhost URL Bug Fixes**: Resolved all hardcoded localhost URLs in admin pages
- **Terminal Escaping Issues**: Documented and resolved shell command problems
- **System Integration**: Enhanced financial reports with payment type verification capabilities

## Current System Status

### ðŸ”´ System Status - STALLED
**Date**: August 16, 2025
**Status**: ðŸ”´ STALLED - A critical CSRF bug blocks all administrative write actions.
**Evidence**:
- Login and navigation to admin pages works correctly.
- Any attempt to submit a form (e.g., add new staff) results in a `403 Forbidden` error.
- This is the primary blocker for full business operations.

**Root Cause Analysis Completed**:
1. âœ… **CSRF Token Generation Failure**: Nginx static file serving for admin pages bypasses the Node.js middleware responsible for generating and attaching the CSRF token. This is the confirmed root cause.

## Project Health: ðŸ”´ STALLED - CRITICAL CSRF BUG

The project has a **CRITICAL CSRF BUG** that prevents core administrative functionality. The system is not fully operational for business use until this is resolved.
- ðŸ”´ **STALLED**: All administrative write actions are blocked.
- âœ… **Production deployment completed and operational for read-only tasks.**
- âœ… **External access established at http://109.123.238.197**
- âœ… **Multi-location database schema implemented**
- âœ… **Authentication system working correctly**

## Team Status
- **Development**: Focused on resolving the critical CSRF bug.
- **Testing**: Awaiting fix to proceed with administrative function testing.
- **Documentation**: All technical documentation up to date.
- **Deployment**: âœ… PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED
- **Support**: System stable for read-only operations.
- **Current Focus**: âœ… Resolving critical CSRF bug by serving admin pages via the backend.
