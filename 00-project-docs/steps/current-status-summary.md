## Critical Issue Resolution (August 18, 2025)

### âœ… Staff Roster Functionality & Database Permissions Resolution (August 18, 2025)
**Issue**: Staff roster dropdown not populating and database permissions causing `SQLITE_READONLY` errors
**Root Cause**: Circular dependency in staff roster design and database file tracked by Git causing permission reversion
**Solution**: Systematic resolution through database schema redesign, new API endpoints, and Git tracking cleanup
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Staff roster system is now fully operational with all features working correctly

### âœ… Critical 500 Internal Server Error Resolution (August 18, 2025)
**Issue**: Frontend was getting 500 Internal Server Errors during transaction creation, completely blocking business operations
**Root Cause**: Multiple interconnected issues including conflicting .env file locations, incorrect systemd WorkingDirectory, and Git tracking of configuration files
**Solution**: Systematic resolution through environment file consolidation, systemd service optimization, and Git tracking cleanup
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - System is now 100% operational with no more 500 errors

## Recent Bug Fixes and Improvements

### âœ… Critical 500 Internal Server Error Resolution (August 18, 2025)
**Issue**: Frontend was getting 500 errors during transaction creation, completely blocking business operations
**Root Cause**: Multiple interconnected issues including conflicting .env file locations, incorrect systemd WorkingDirectory, and Git tracking of configuration files
**Solution**: Systematic resolution through environment file consolidation, systemd service optimization, and Git tracking cleanup
**Technical Implementation**: 
  - Consolidated two conflicting .env files into single root location
  - Updated systemd service to use correct WorkingDirectory and ExecStart paths
  - Removed deploy.sh and .env files from Git tracking to prevent overwrites
  - Fixed database path resolution for proper .env file access
**Result**: Transaction creation now works perfectly with 201 Created responses

### âœ… Input Validation Middleware Fix (2025-08-16)
**Issue**: Backend was rejecting valid transaction data with "Invalid input data" errors
**Root Cause**: Input validation middleware was validating calculated fields (`payment_amount`, `masseuse_fee`) that should not be validated at middleware level
**Solution**: Removed validation for calculated fields from the input validation middleware
**Result**: Transaction form submission now works correctly

### âœ… Service Dropdown Population Fix (2025-08-16)
**Issue**: Service dropdown was not populating with services after location selection
**Root Cause**: Missing `let` declarations in `updateServiceOptions()` and `updateDurationOptions()` functions
**Solution**: Added proper variable declarations for dropdown element references
**Result**: Service dropdown now populates with 18 services for "In-Shop" location
