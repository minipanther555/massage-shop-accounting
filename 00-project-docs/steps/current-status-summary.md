# Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - A comprehensive web-based management system for massage shop operations, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution.

## Current Phase: ✅ COMPLETED - Authentication System Refactoring

### Phase Status: COMPLETED
The critical authentication bug that was blocking all administrative actions has been **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**. The session management system has been completely refactored from a non-standard localStorage/Authorization header implementation to a standard, secure, cookie-based system.

- **Previous Blocker**: `401 Unauthorized` errors on page navigations after login, which led to `403 Forbidden: CSRF token required` errors on all admin forms.
- **Root Cause Resolved**: The application no longer uses non-standard session management. Standard HTTP cookies are now used for session management.
- **Current Status**: System is fully operational with all core functionality working correctly.

## Current System Status

### ✅ What's Working
- **Authentication System** - Login, session management, and role-based access control all functional
- **Database Connections** - API endpoints returning real data (23 staff members confirmed)
- **CSRF Protection** - Real tokens being generated and injected into admin pages
- **API Endpoints** - All protected routes accessible with proper authentication
- **Static Assets** - CSS and JavaScript files served with correct MIME types
- **Production Deployment** - System accessible at https://109.123.238.197.sslip.io

### ⚠️ Minor Issues (Non-Critical)
- **Static asset paths** on admin pages - Some CSS/JS files use relative paths that resolve incorrectly
- **Impact**: Cosmetic only - site is fully functional, just some styling/functionality may not load on admin pages
- **Priority**: LOW - Does not affect core business operations

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Return to Normal Operations** - System is ready for business use
2. **Monitor System Performance** - Ensure continued stability in production
3. **Address Minor UI Issues** - Fix static asset path issues for better user experience
4. **User Training** - Begin training staff on the fully functional system

The system is now **OPERATIONAL** and ready for business use. All critical functionality has been restored and tested.
