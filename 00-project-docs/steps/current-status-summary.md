# Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - A comprehensive web-based management system for massage shop operations, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution.

## Current Phase: üî¥ IN PROGRESS - Database Architecture Restructuring for Staff Management

### Phase Status: NEW CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED
**DATABASE ARCHITECTURE ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: While the staff roster functionality is working, we've discovered a fundamental architectural problem with the staff management system. The staff administration page is broken because it's using the wrong table structure, and we need to restructure the database to properly separate daily operations from long-term staff management.

**Current Focus**: üî¥ **IN PROGRESS** - We need to restructure the database schema to fix the staff administration page and establish proper separation between daily operations and long-term staff management.

- **Previous Blocker**: Staff roster dropdown not populating and database permissions causing `SQLITE_READONLY` errors
- **Root Cause Resolved**: Circular dependency in staff roster design and database file tracked by Git causing permission reversion
- **New Blocker**: Staff administration page broken due to database architecture mismatch
- **Current Status**: Staff roster system working, but staff administration page completely broken

## Current System Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working (Staff Roster System - 100% Operational)
- **Staff Roster System** - **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - All features working correctly
- **Staff Addition to Roster** - Staff can be added sequentially to daily roster
- **Dropdown Population** - Populates with all 16 available staff names from master list
- **Database Operations** - INSERT/UPDATE operations working correctly for roster management
- **API Endpoints** - All staff roster endpoints functional and returning correct data
- **Transaction Page Compatibility** - New transaction page still works with roster data

### ‚ùå What's Broken (Staff Administration System - 0% Operational)
- **Staff Administration Page** - **COMPLETELY BROKEN** - Cannot load or function
- **Staff Management Functions** - Cannot add, edit, or remove staff members
- **Payment Tracking** - Cannot view or manage staff payment data
- **Long-term Staff Data** - Cannot access historical staff information

### üî¥ Root Cause: Database Architecture Mismatch
**Problem**: The staff administration page is broken because it's using the wrong table structure for its intended purpose.

**Current Architecture (INCORRECT)**:
- **`staff` table**: Simple master list with only `{id, name, active, created_at}` - TOO SIMPLE
- **`staff_roster` table**: Daily roster with complex payment tracking fields like `total_fees_earned`, `total_fees_paid`, `last_payment_date`, etc. - WRONG PLACE

**What Should Happen (CORRECT)**:
- **`staff_roster` table**: Should ONLY contain daily stats (position, masseuse_name, status, today_massages, busy_until)
- **`staff` table**: Should contain ALL long-term payment tracking fields (total_fees_earned, total_fees_paid, last_payment_date, hire_date, notes, etc.)

**Why This Makes Sense**:
- **Staff roster** = "Who's working today and what's their queue status?" (daily, clearable)
- **Staff master** = "What's the total payment history and long-term stats for each staff member?" (permanent, not clearable)

### ‚úÖ Issues Resolved
- **Staff Roster Dropdown Issue**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Fixed by creating separate master staff list and new API endpoint
- **Database Permissions Issue**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Resolved by removing Git tracking and fixing file ownership
- **Staff Addition to Roster**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Now works correctly with INSERT/UPDATE operations
- **API Method Conflicts**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Resolved by renaming conflicting methods
- **Circular Dependency**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Eliminated by separating master list from daily roster
- **Critical 500 Internal Server Error**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Fixed through systematic database and systemd configuration fixes
- **Two-database problem**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Resolved by removing Git tracking of second database
- **Environment file conflicts**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Consolidated to single .env file in correct location
- **Systemd service configuration**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Fixed WorkingDirectory and ExecStart paths
- **Git tracking conflicts**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Removed deploy.sh and .env from tracking to prevent overwrites
- **Bangkok Time Auto-Fill** - Confirmed working when transaction parameters are selected
- **Staff Dropdown** - Confirmed working correctly (was a data issue, not functionality)
- **CSP Violations** - All resolved, system now uses HTTPS consistently
- **Static Asset Paths** - All resolved, CSS/JS files now load correctly
- **Input Validation Middleware** - ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Removed validation for calculated fields
- **Service Dropdown Population** - ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Fixed variable declaration issues

### üéØ System Status: PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL
**SYSTEM PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL**: The system is **PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL** with staff roster functionality working correctly, but staff administration page completely broken due to database architecture mismatch. We need to restructure the database schema to properly separate daily operations from long-term staff management.

**Impact**: The system can handle daily staff roster operations but cannot manage long-term staff data, add new hires, or track payment history. This severely limits business operations and staff management capabilities.

## Critical Issue Resolution (August 18, 2025)

### üî¥ NEW CRITICAL: Database Architecture Mismatch Issue (August 18, 2025)
**Issue**: Staff administration page completely broken due to wrong table structure for payment tracking
**Root Cause**: Payment tracking fields stored in daily roster table instead of master staff table
**Solution**: Restructure database schema to separate daily operations from long-term staff management
**Status**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - Staff administration page completely broken until fixed

### ‚úÖ Staff Roster Functionality & Database Permissions Resolution (August 18, 2025)
**Issue**: Staff roster dropdown not populating and database permissions causing `SQLITE_READONLY` errors
**Root Cause**: Circular dependency in staff roster design and database file tracked by Git causing permission reversion
**Solution**: Systematic resolution through database schema redesign, new API endpoints, and Git tracking cleanup
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Staff roster system is now fully operational with all features working correctly

### ‚úÖ Critical 500 Internal Server Error Resolution (August 18, 2025)
**Issue**: Frontend was getting 500 Internal Server Errors during transaction creation, completely blocking business operations
**Root Cause**: Multiple interconnected issues including conflicting .env file locations, incorrect systemd WorkingDirectory, and Git tracking of configuration files
**Solution**: Systematic resolution through environment file consolidation, systemd service optimization, and Git tracking cleanup
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - System is now 100% operational with no more 500 errors

## Recent Bug Fixes and Improvements

### ‚úÖ Critical 500 Internal Server Error Resolution (August 18, 2025)
**Issue**: Frontend was getting 500 errors during transaction creation, completely blocking business operations
**Root Cause**: Multiple interconnected issues including conflicting .env file locations, incorrect systemd WorkingDirectory, and Git tracking of configuration files
**Solution**: Systematic resolution through environment file consolidation, systemd service optimization, and Git tracking cleanup
**Technical Implementation**: 
  - Consolidated two conflicting .env files into single root location
  - Updated systemd service to use correct WorkingDirectory and ExecStart paths
  - Removed deploy.sh and .env files from Git tracking to prevent overwrites
  - Fixed database path resolution for proper .env file access
**Result**: Transaction creation now works perfectly with 201 Created responses

### ‚úÖ Input Validation Middleware Fix (2025-08-16)
**Issue**: Backend was rejecting valid transaction data with "Invalid input data" errors
**Root Cause**: Input validation middleware was validating calculated fields (`payment_amount`, `masseuse_fee`) that should not be validated at middleware level
**Solution**: Removed validation for calculated fields from the input validation middleware
**Result**: Transaction form submission now works correctly

### ‚úÖ Service Dropdown Population Fix (2025-08-16)
**Issue**: Service dropdown was not populating with services after location selection
**Root Cause**: Missing `let` declarations in `updateServiceOptions()` and `updateDurationOptions()` functions
**Solution**: Added proper variable declarations for dropdown element references
**Result**: Service dropdown now populates with 18 services for "In-Shop" location
