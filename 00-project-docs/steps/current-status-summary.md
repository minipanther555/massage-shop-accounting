# Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - A comprehensive web-based management system for massage shop operations, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution.

## Current Phase: âœ… COMPLETED - Transaction Form Functionality

### Phase Status: COMPLETED
The critical authentication bug that was blocking all administrative actions has been **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**. The session management system has been completely refactored from a non-standard localStorage/Authorization header implementation to a standard, secure, cookie-based system. Additionally, comprehensive end-to-end testing has confirmed that the entire system is now fully operational.

**Current Focus**: âœ… All transaction form functionality issues have been completely resolved. The transaction form is now fully functional with complete end-to-end operation.

- **Previous Blocker**: `401 Unauthorized` errors on page navigations after login, which led to `403 Forbidden: CSRF token required` errors on all admin forms.
- **Root Cause Resolved**: The application no longer uses non-standard session management. Standard HTTP cookies are now used for session management.
- **Current Status**: System is fully operational with all core functionality working correctly.

The comprehensive end-to-end testing has confirmed that the system is now **100% OPERATIONAL** with all critical functionality working correctly. All transaction form issues have been completely resolved, and the system is ready for live business operations.

## Recent Bug Fixes and Improvements

### âœ… Input Validation Middleware Fix (2025-08-16)
**Issue**: Backend was rejecting valid transaction data with "Invalid input data" errors
**Root Cause**: Input validation middleware was validating calculated fields (`payment_amount`, `masseuse_fee`) that should not be validated at middleware level
**Solution**: Removed validation for calculated fields from the input validation middleware
**Result**: Transaction form submission now works correctly

### âœ… Service Dropdown Population Fix (2025-08-16)
**Issue**: Service dropdown was not populating with services after location selection
**Root Cause**: Missing `let` declarations in `updateServiceOptions()` and `updateDurationOptions()` functions
**Solution**: Added proper variable declarations for dropdown element references
**Result**: Service dropdown now populates with 18 services for "In-Shop" location

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
