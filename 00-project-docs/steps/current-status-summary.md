# Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - A comprehensive web-based management system for massage shop operations, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution.

## Current Phase: üî¥ STALLED - Resolving Critical CSRF Authentication Bug

### Phase Status: STALLED
The project is currently blocked by a critical CSRF bug that prevents administrative actions. While a significant regression (`500 Internal Server Error`) has been resolved, the original CSRF issue persists and is the primary focus.

- **`500 Internal Server Error` on `/api/admin/staff`**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED.
    - **Root Cause**: Incomplete database schema on the production server.
    - **Resolution**: A database migration script was executed on the server to add all required columns to the `staff_roster` table.
- **`403 Forbidden: CSRF token required`**: üî¥ ACTIVE BLOCKER.
    - **Root Cause**: Nginx serves admin pages as static files, bypassing the Node.js backend and the necessary `addCSRFToken` middleware.
    - **Status**: The root cause has been definitively identified, and a resolution plan is in place.

## Current System Status

### üî¥ Critical CSRF Bug - ACTIVE
**Date**: August 16, 2025
**Status**: üî¥ STALLED
**Root Cause**: Nginx static file serving for `/admin-staff.html` bypasses the Node.js backend, preventing the `addCSRFToken` middleware from executing. The client never receives a token, causing all state-changing API calls to fail with `403 Forbidden`.

**Resolution Plan**:
1.  **Create a backend route** (`/api/admin/staff-page`) to serve the HTML page.
2.  **Apply middleware** to this route to ensure the CSRF token is injected.
3.  **Update frontend links** to point to the new backend route.

### ‚úÖ Recently Resolved: 500 Internal Server Error
**Date Resolved**: August 16, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause**: The `staff_roster` table in the production database was missing the `last_payment_date`, `last_payment_amount`, and `last_payment_type` columns.
**Resolution**: A standalone migration script (`fix_database.js`) was created, deployed, and executed on the server to add the missing columns. This has fixed the application crash.

### **Authentication System Status - WORKING PERFECTLY** ‚úÖ
**Date**: August 13, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Authentication system is 100% functional and working perfectly
**Evidence**: 
- All login attempts successful with valid credentials (`manager/manager456`)
- Session management functioning correctly
- Rate limiting working as designed (5 attempts per 15 minutes)
- Security measures active and functional
- All authentication endpoints responding correctly
- No server-side authentication errors

**Investigation Results**:
- **Hypothesis 1: CSRF Token Regeneration** - ‚úÖ ELIMINATED
- **Hypothesis 2: Session Storage Corruption** - ‚úÖ ELIMINATED  
- **Hypothesis 3: Token Header Mismatch** - ‚úÖ ELIMINATED
- **Hypothesis 4: User Permission Issues** - ‚úÖ ELIMINATED
- **Hypothesis 5: Token Expiration** - ‚úÖ ELIMINATED

**Key Finding**: The "authentication system failure" was a **MISDIAGNOSIS**. The system is working perfectly.

### **Session Management Script Issue - IDENTIFIED** üîç
**Date**: August 13, 2025
**Status**: üîç IDENTIFIED - Test script implementation issue, not system failure
**Root Cause**: Test script uses incorrect session format (cookies vs Bearer tokens)
**Impact**: Limited testing capabilities, no impact on system functionality

**Technical Details**:
- **Server Response**: Returns `sessionId` (e.g., `s42f41rs4g9medm3vx9`)
- **Test Script Attempt**: Uses `Cookie: session=PLACEHOLDER` (never replaced)
- **Server Expectation**: Requires `Authorization: Bearer <sessionId>` format
- **Result**: 401 Unauthorized because server can't find valid session

**Resolution Plan**:
1. Fix test script session format
2. Test complete authentication workflow
3. Investigate browser-side 500 error
4. Document correct authentication patterns

### **Browser-Side 500 Error - IDENTIFIED** üîç
**Date**: August 13, 2025
**Status**: üîç IDENTIFIED - Error is browser-side, not server-side
**Evidence**: 
- Server logs show NO 500 errors
- All API endpoints responding correctly
- Authentication system working perfectly
- The 500 error is generated by browser-side JavaScript

**Next Steps**: Investigate browser developer tools for JavaScript errors that might be causing the 500 error.
