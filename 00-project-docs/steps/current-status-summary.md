# Current Status Summary

## Project Overview
EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - A comprehensive web-based management system for massage shop operations, replacing Google Sheets with a modern, scalable solution.

## Current Phase: ðŸ”´ STALLED - Refactoring Core Authentication

### Phase Status: STALLED
The project is currently blocked by a critical authentication bug that prevents all administrative actions. The application is unusable for its core purpose until the session management system is refactored to use standard HTTP cookies.

- **Current Blocker**: `401 Unauthorized` errors on page navigations after login, which leads to `403 Forbidden: CSRF token required` errors on all admin forms.
- **Root Cause Identified**: The application uses a non-standard session management implementation based on `localStorage` and `Authorization` headers, which is incompatible with browser navigation.
- **Resolution Plan**: Refactor the entire session management system to use secure, `httpOnly` cookies. Full details are in the `current-phase.md` document and the relevant bug report.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1.  **Implement Cookie-Based Sessions**: Refactor the backend to set and read session cookies.
2.  **Simplify Frontend Auth**: Remove manual `Authorization` header logic from the frontend JavaScript.
3.  **End-to-End Validation**: Run the automated browser test to confirm the fix resolves login, navigation, and CSRF issues in a single, verified workflow.
