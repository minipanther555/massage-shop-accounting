## Next Phase: Re-resolve CSRF Issue and proceed to MULTI-LOCATION AUTHENTICATION

### Codebase Reset and Refocus
Due to a series of regressions caused by a misunderstanding of the server environment, the codebase has been reset on the `testing03` branch to a known-good state (commit `9cf7381`).

### Current Objectives
1.  **Restore Application Code**: Restore critical backend files (`server.js`, middleware) that were empty due to a broken git rollback.
2.  **Diagnose and Fix the True Root Cause**: Apply the Triage & Debugging Protocol to definitively resolve the application instability.
3.  **Proceed to Planned Work**: Once the application is stable, proceed with the original next phase: Multi-Location Authentication Implementation.

### Debugging Post-Mortem: From CSRF Misdiagnosis to Schema Mismatch Discovery
The primary objective of this phase was to resolve a persistent CSRF issue. However, after a prolonged and circular debugging process, the root cause was discovered to be entirely unrelated to the CSRF system.

1.  **Initial State**: The `testing03` branch had multiple empty files (`server.js`, `middleware/*.js`) due to a flawed git rollback. This was the primary source of instability, causing the server to crash on startup.
2.  **File Restoration**: The correct file contents were retrieved from the `main08` branch and restored, allowing the server to start.
3.  **CSRF Misdiagnosis**: Initial tests failed with `403 Forbidden` errors, which was incorrectly interpreted as a CSRF issue. A validation script (`csrf_validation_test.js`) was created.
4.  **The "Red Herring" Loop**: For an extended period, the debugging focused on the CSRF system. This was due to a combination of misleading error messages and a failure to correctly manage the server process, which kept port 3000 occupied (`EADDRINUSE` error), preventing clean test runs. The repeated failures of `kill %1` and incorrect assumptions about the server state prolonged this loop.
5.  **The Breakthrough - Extensive Logging**: Following the Triage & Debugging Protocol, extensive logging was added to the entire request lifecycle (`server.js`, `admin.js`, etc.). When the test was re-run, the server logs provided an unambiguous trace.
6.  **True Root Cause Identified**: The logs revealed two key facts:
    *   The CSRF token generation and validation were working **perfectly**.
    *   The actual error was an `SQLITE_ERROR: table staff_roster has no column named hire_date`, which occurred *after* the CSRF validation had passed.
7.  **The Fix**: The root cause was a schema mismatch between the application code (which expected a `hire_date` column) and the local database file (which did not have one). A simple migration was added to `database.js` to add the missing column if it didn't exist.

**Conclusion**: The "CSRF issue" was a classic case of misinterpreting symptoms. The true problem was a broken local environment (empty files, zombie processes) followed by a database schema mismatch. The Triage & Debugging Protocol, specifically the emphasis on comprehensive logging, was essential to breaking the cycle of misdiagnosis and identifying the real bug.
