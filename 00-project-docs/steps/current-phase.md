# Current Phase: 🔴 IN PROGRESS - Database Architecture Restructuring for Staff Management

## Phase Overview
**DATABASE ARCHITECTURE ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: While the staff roster functionality is working, we've discovered a fundamental architectural problem with the staff management system. The staff administration page is broken because it's using the wrong table structure, and we need to restructure the database to properly separate daily operations from long-term staff management.

## Current Status: 🔴 IN PROGRESS - Database Architecture Restructuring for Staff Management

### What Was Previously Resolved (Critical Issues)
- **Staff Roster Dropdown Issue**: ✅ RESOLVED - Dropdown now populates correctly with all available staff names from master staff list
- **Database Permissions Issue**: ✅ RESOLVED - `SQLITE_READONLY: attempt to write a readonly database` errors completely resolved
- **Staff Addition to Roster**: ✅ RESOLVED - Staff can now be successfully added to daily roster with proper INSERT/UPDATE operations
- **Git Tracking Conflicts**: ✅ RESOLVED - Database file was tracked by Git, causing automatic permission reversion

### New Issue Identified: Database Architecture Mismatch
**Problem**: The staff administration page is broken because it's using the wrong table structure for its intended purpose.

**Current Architecture (INCORRECT)**:
- **`staff` table**: Simple master list with only `{id, name, active, created_at}` - TOO SIMPLE
- **`staff_roster` table**: Daily roster with complex payment tracking fields like `total_fees_earned`, `total_fees_paid`, `last_payment_date`, etc. - WRONG PLACE

**What Should Happen (CORRECT)**:
- **`staff_roster` table**: Should ONLY contain daily stats (position, masseuse_name, status, today_massages, busy_until)
- **`staff` table**: Should contain ALL long-term payment tracking fields (total_fees_earned, total_fees_paid, last_payment_date, hire_date, notes, etc.)

**Why This Makes Sense**:
- **Staff roster** = "Who's working today and what's their queue status?" (daily, clearable)
- **Staff master** = "What's the total payment history and long-term stats for each staff member?" (permanent, not clearable)

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Staff Administration Page**: Currently trying to read/write payment data from `staff_roster` table (daily table)
- **Payment Tracking Data**: Currently stored in `staff_roster` table where it gets cleared daily
- **Long-term Staff Management**: Needs permanent storage in `staff` table, not daily roster
- **Daily Clearing Functionality**: Should only clear daily stats, not long-term payment data

### Solution Required
1. **Database Schema Restructuring**: Move payment tracking fields from `staff_roster` to `staff` table
2. **Simplify Staff Roster**: Keep only daily fields in `staff_roster` table
3. **Update Admin Endpoints**: Change staff administration to use `staff` table for permanent data
4. **Maintain Data Integrity**: Ensure daily clearing only affects daily stats, not long-term data

### Recent Development Work (August 18, 2025)
**Comprehensive Diagnostic Script Created**: Developed `check_database_health.js` to systematically check all known database and environment issues:
- **Two-Database Problem**: Check for duplicate database files
- **Database Permissions**: Verify ownership and permissions
- **Environment Files**: Check .env file locations and content
- **Git Tracking**: Verify database and .env files are not tracked
- **Systemd Service**: Check service configuration and status
- **PM2 Status**: Check for PM2 processes running as root
- **Automated Processes**: Look for cron jobs or systemd timers
- **File System**: Check directory contents and permissions

**Script Evolution**: Initially had false positive for Git tracking due to broad grep patterns, refined to use precise patterns (`massage_shop\.db$` for DB files, `^\.env$` for .env files).

## Next Phase: Database Architecture Restructuring

### Immediate Next Actions (August 18, 2025)
1. **Restructure Database Schema** - Move payment tracking fields to correct tables
   - **Priority**: CRITICAL - Required to fix staff administration page
   - **Impact**: Staff administration page completely broken until fixed
   - **Required**: Database schema migration and API endpoint updates

2. **Fix 'Busy Until' Time Reset Issue** - Staff status shows "busy" perpetually even after time passes
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for staff scheduling and customer service
   - **Impact**: Staff appear unavailable when they should be free
   - **Required**: Implement automatic status reset mechanism for expired busy times

3. **Add Duration and Location to Financial Reports** - Recent transactions and financial reports need duration and location columns
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for business reporting and analysis
   - **Impact**: Financial reports lack essential transaction details
   - **Required**: Update admin-reports.html and backend/routes/reports.js to include duration and location breakdowns

### What Was Previously Implemented (Before Staff Roster Discovery)
1. **✅ cookie-parser middleware** - Added to handle HTTP cookies
2. **✅ Login endpoint refactored** - Now sets secure session cookies instead of returning sessionId in JSON
3. **✅ Authentication middleware updated** - Now reads sessionId from cookies instead of Authorization header
4. **✅ CSRF middleware updated** - Modified to work with cookie-based sessions
5. **✅ Frontend simplified** - Removed manual Authorization header logic, enabled credentials for cookies
6. **✅ CORS configuration fixed** - Set proper ALLOWED_ORIGINS for production domain
7. **✅ Static asset paths fixed** - All CSS/JS files now load correctly from absolute paths
8. **✅ CSP violations resolved** - System now uses HTTPS consistently throughout
9. **✅ Input validation middleware fixed** - Removed validation for calculated fields
10. **✅ Service dropdown population fixed** - Added proper variable declarations

## Current Status: 🔴 IN PROGRESS - Database Architecture Restructuring

### Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ **Staff Roster Dropdown**: Now populates correctly with all 16 available staff names
- ✅ **Staff Addition**: Staff can be successfully added to daily roster with proper database operations
- ✅ **Database Permissions**: Fixed and stable, no more `SQLITE_READONLY` errors
- ✅ **API Endpoints**: All staff-related endpoints working correctly
- ✅ **Git Tracking Clean**: Database file no longer tracked, preventing permission reversion
- ✅ **Transaction Page Compatibility**: New transaction page still works with roster data
- ✅ **System Stability**: No more 500 errors during staff roster operations

### Issues Resolved
- ✅ **Staff Roster Dropdown Issue**: Fixed by creating separate master staff list and new API endpoint
- ✅ **Database Permissions Issue**: Resolved by removing Git tracking and fixing file ownership
- ✅ **Staff Addition to Roster**: Now works correctly with INSERT/UPDATE operations
- ✅ **API Method Conflicts**: Resolved by renaming conflicting methods
- ✅ **Circular Dependency**: Eliminated by separating master list from daily roster

### New Issues Identified
- 🔴 **Staff Administration Page Broken**: Using wrong table structure for payment tracking
- 🔴 **Database Architecture Mismatch**: Payment tracking fields in wrong tables
- 🔴 **Daily vs. Long-term Data Confusion**: Need clear separation of concerns

## Next Phase: Database Architecture Restructuring

The staff roster system is working correctly, but we've identified a fundamental architectural problem with the staff management system. The staff administration page is broken because it's trying to manage long-term payment data in a table designed for daily operations.

### System Status: PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL
The system is **PARTIALLY OPERATIONAL** with staff roster functionality working correctly, but staff administration page completely broken due to database architecture mismatch. We need to restructure the database schema to properly separate daily operations from long-term staff management.

The system is ready for the next phase of database architecture restructuring to fix the staff administration page and establish proper data separation.
