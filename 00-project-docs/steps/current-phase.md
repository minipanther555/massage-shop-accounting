## Lessons Learned
1. **Server Process Management**: Critical to ensure code updates are reflected
2. **Data Validation**: Essential to validate at multiple levels
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling improves user experience
4. **Testing**: Thorough testing prevents production issues
5. **Architecture**: Simple, reliable solutions often better than complex optimizations
6. **JavaScript Function Definitions**: All functions called must be defined to prevent page loading failures
7. **API URL Management**: Absolute URLs prevent 404 errors when frontend and backend are on different ports
8. **Route Order in Express**: Specific routes must come before parameterized routes to prevent conflicts
9. **Unwanted Features**: Implementing features not requested by users can lead to data corruption and complexity
10. **Database Integrity**: Regular verification of data integrity prevents corruption from spreading
11. **Function Name Consistency**: Use consistent function names across the codebase (showToast vs showMessage)
12. **API URL Consistency**: Maintain consistent URL patterns to prevent 501 errors and improve reliability
13. **Business Logic in UI**: Filter dropdowns should reflect business needs, not technical implementation details
14. **User Experience Design**: Button placement significantly impacts usability and discoverability
15. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all related functionality when fixing bugs to prevent cascading issues
16. **Delete vs Soft Delete**: Choose appropriate deletion strategy based on business requirements
17. **Confirmation Dialogs**: Always confirm destructive actions like permanent deletion
18. **Filter Labeling**: Ensure UI labels accurately reflect the actual functionality of filters
19. **Systematic Debugging**: Use the 5-hypothesis testing protocol to identify root causes, not just symptoms
20. **Port Configuration**: Ensure frontend and backend are configured to use the same ports
21. **Data Type Consistency**: Backend should return consistent data types (numbers vs strings) for frontend processing
22. **Multiple Debugging Rounds**: Complex bugs may require multiple rounds of systematic debugging to identify all root causes
23. **Frontend-Backend Coordination**: Both sides must be fixed together for complex issues involving data flow
24. **Error Log Analysis**: Browser console logs provide critical clues about the actual root causes of issues
25. **API Endpoint Consistency**: Frontend and backend must use matching endpoint paths to prevent 404 errors
26. **Response Format Compatibility**: Frontend data processing must match backend response structure
27. **Comprehensive Hypothesis Testing**: Testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously accelerates bug resolution
28. **Defensive Programming**: Implement null/undefined checks and safe property access throughout the codebase
