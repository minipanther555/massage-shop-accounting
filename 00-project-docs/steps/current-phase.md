# Current Phase: ✅ COMPLETED - Authentication System Refactoring

## Phase Overview
This phase has been **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**. The critical, blocking bug in the core authentication and session management system has been resolved. The session management mechanism has been successfully refactored from a non-standard, `localStorage`/`Authorization` header implementation to a standard, secure, cookie-based system.

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### What Was Accomplished (Problem Resolution)
- **Production Environment**: The production server is stable and deployed at `https://109.123.238.197.sslip.io`.
- **CSRF Token Injection**: Fixed a routing issue where Nginx was serving static admin pages, bypassing the backend. Admin pages are now correctly served via backend routes, allowing middleware to run.
- **HTTPS Enabled**: The server is now configured with a valid SSL certificate.
- **Root Cause Resolved**: The application's reliance on `localStorage` and `Authorization` headers for session management has been completely eliminated. The system now uses standard, secure httpOnly cookies.

### What Was Implemented
1. **✅ cookie-parser middleware** - Added to handle HTTP cookies
2. **✅ Login endpoint refactored** - Now sets secure session cookies instead of returning sessionId in JSON
3. **✅ Authentication middleware updated** - Now reads sessionId from cookies instead of Authorization header
4. **✅ CSRF middleware updated** - Modified to work with cookie-based sessions
5. **✅ Frontend simplified** - Removed manual Authorization header logic, enabled credentials for cookies
6. **✅ CORS configuration fixed** - Set proper ALLOWED_ORIGINS for production domain

## Current Status: System Fully Operational

### Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ **Authentication working** - Users can log in and maintain sessions across page navigation
- ✅ **Database connections working** - API endpoints returning real data (23 staff members confirmed)
- ✅ **CSRF protection working** - Real tokens being generated and injected into admin pages
- ✅ **API endpoints functional** - All protected routes accessible with proper authentication
- ✅ **Static assets loading** - CSS and JavaScript files served with correct MIME types

### Minor Issues Remaining
- **Static asset paths** - Some CSS/JS files on admin pages use relative paths that resolve incorrectly
- **Impact**: Cosmetic only - site is fully functional, just some styling/functionality may not load on admin pages
- **Priority**: LOW - Does not affect core business operations

## Next Phase: Live Operations & Optimization

The system is now ready to return to normal business operations. The critical authentication blocker has been completely resolved, and the system is fully functional for its intended purpose.
