# Current Phase: Production Deployment & Live Operations

## Phase Overview
This phase focuses on deploying the system to production VPS and establishing live operations. The goal is to make the system accessible to business users from any device with internet access, enabling real-world business operations.

## Phase Objectives
1. **VPS Deployment**: Deploy system to production VPS with all security measures
2. **External Access**: Configure system for internet access and external user access
3. **Production Environment**: Set up production monitoring, logging, and management
4. **System Handover**: Complete user training and handover to business users

## Current Status: ðŸ”´ STALLED - Resolving Critical CSRF Authentication Bug

### What Was Accomplished
- **`500 Internal Server Error` on `/api/admin/staff`**: âœ… RESOLVED.
    - **Root Cause**: Incomplete database schema. The `staff_roster` table was missing `last_payment_date`, `last_payment_amount`, and `last_payment_type` columns.
    - **Resolution**: Created and executed a migration script (`fix_database.js`) directly on the server to add the missing columns, resolving the application crash.

### Current Blocker: CSRF Token Failure
- **Symptom**: All state-changing actions on administrative pages (e.g., adding staff) fail with a `403 Forbidden: CSRF token required` error.
- **Root Cause Identified**: The Nginx server is configured to serve `.html` files (like `admin-staff.html`) as static assets. This bypasses the Node.js backend entirely. As a result, the `addCSRFToken` middleware is never executed, and the frontend never receives the necessary token to perform authenticated actions.
- **Status**: This is the original bug reported, which was previously masked by the `500 Internal Server Error` regression. The investigation is now correctly focused on this root cause.

### Key Technical Achievements
1.  **Systematic Debugging**: Successfully diagnosed and resolved a `500 Internal Server Error` by creating targeted schema verification and migration scripts.
2.  **Definitive CSRF Diagnosis**: Created a specialized diagnostic script (`debug_csrf_post_workflow.js`) that replicated the full authentication and form submission workflow, successfully isolating the root cause to the missing token on page load.
3.  **Log Configuration Confirmed**: Verified that application logs are managed by `systemd` and are being written to `/var/log/massage-shop/`.

### Bug Fixes and Resolutions
- **Database Schema Mismatch**: âœ… RESOLVED - The `staff_roster` table on the production server has been fully migrated to include all required columns, eliminating the `SQLITE_ERROR` and resolving the `500 Internal Server Error`.

## Next Phase: CSRF Bug Resolution & Feature Completion
The immediate next steps are focused on fixing the CSRF issue without re-introducing previous Nginx-related bugs.

### Current Objectives
1.  **Implement Backend Page Serving**: Create new, authenticated backend routes to serve the admin HTML pages (e.g., create `/api/admin/staff-page` to serve `admin-staff.html`).
2.  **Update Frontend Navigation**: Modify the frontend links to point to the new backend page-serving routes instead of the static `.html` files.
3.  **Verify CSRF Token Flow**: Re-run diagnostic tests to confirm that accessing the new backend route correctly provides a CSRF token.
4.  **End-to-End Test**: Perform a final test of the "add staff" functionality to confirm the entire workflow is successful.
