   - Check PM2 status: `pm2 status` âœ…
   - Verify massage-shop process is running âœ…
   - Check process logs: `pm2 logs massage-shop --lines 100` âœ…

2. **API Endpoint Testing**: âœ… COMPLETED
   - Test health endpoint: `curl http://109.123.238.197/health` âœ…
   - Test API endpoints: `curl http://109.123.238.197/api/auth/login` âœ…
   - Identify which endpoints are failing âœ…
   - Check Nginx configuration for API routing âœ…

3. **Process Fixes**: âœ… COMPLETED
   - Restart PM2 process if needed: `pm2 restart massage-shop` âœ…
   - Check for configuration errors âœ…
   - Verify environment variables are loaded âœ…
   - Test connectivity after fixes âœ…

**Root Causes Identified and Fixed**:
- Database path wrong in .env file: `/opt/massage-shop/backend/data/massage_shop.db` â†’ `/opt/massage-shop/data/massage_shop.db`
- Port conflict from stale Node.js process (PID 6082) holding port 3000
- PM2 process configuration issues

**Methodology Used**: Systematic 5-hypothesis debugging protocol
**Result**: All API endpoints functional, process stable with 25s+ uptime

### Phase 2: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Multi-Location Authentication Implementation
1. **Database Schema Updates**:
   - Create users table with location_id support
   - Add authentication fields (username, password_hash, role, location_id)
   - Create indexes for performance
   - Test schema creation and constraints

2. **Business Account Creation**:
   - Create all 6 required accounts:
     - manager49/iloveeiw49 (location_id: 1)
     - reception49/hello123 (location_id: 1)
     - manager9/iloveeiw9 (location_id: 2)
     - reception9/hello999 (location_id: 2)
     - manager33/iloveeiw33 (location_id: 3)
     - reception33/hello333 (location_id: 3)

3. **Authentication System Update**:
   - Replace hardcoded users in auth.js with database queries
   - Implement location-based access control
   - Update session management for location support
   - Test authentication for all accounts

4. **Location-Based Access Control**:
   - Implement data filtering by location_id
   - Update all API endpoints to respect location boundaries
   - Test data isolation between locations
   - Verify cross-location access restrictions

### Phase 3: ðŸŸ¡ HIGH - HTTPS Configuration
1. **SSL Certificate Setup**:
   - Install Certbot for Let's Encrypt certificates
   - Generate SSL certificate for domain/IP
   - Configure automatic renewal
   - Test certificate validity

2. **Nginx HTTPS Configuration**:
   - Update Nginx configuration for HTTPS
   - Configure HTTP to HTTPS redirect
   - Update security headers for HTTPS
   - Test HTTPS functionality

3. **Security Headers Verification**:
   - Ensure all security headers work with HTTPS
   - Test CSP, HSTS, and other security measures
   - Verify encryption is working correctly
   - Test security compliance

### Phase 4: Live Operations & Optimization (After Critical Issues Resolved)
1. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor production performance metrics
   - Track user activity and system usage
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Monitor system health and stability

2. **User Support & Issue Resolution**:
