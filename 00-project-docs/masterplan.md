# EIW Massage Shop Bookkeeping System - Master Plan

## Project Overview
A comprehensive bookkeeping and management system for a massage shop, designed to handle staff management, service tracking, financial reporting, and daily operations management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (Web Application)
- **Technology Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Authentication**: Role-based access control (Staff, Manager, Admin)
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic content loading and form handling

### Backend (API Server)
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLite3 driver
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses
- **Authentication**: JWT-based session management
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and business rule enforcement

### Database Schema
- **Staff Management**: Staff profiles, roles, and permissions
- **Services**: Service definitions, pricing, and location-based fees
- **Transactions**: Daily transaction records with staff assignments
- **Financial Data**: Revenue tracking, expense management, and reporting

## Core Features

- Bulk pricing updates and percentage-based adjustments
- Service activation/deactivation management

### 3. Transaction Processing
- Daily transaction recording
- Staff assignment and commission tracking
- End-of-day summaries and financial reports
- Historical data analysis and reporting

### 4. Financial Reporting

## Critical Issues

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Staff Administration Page Database Architecture Issue (2025-08-18) - âœ… RESOLVED 2024-08-24
**Issue**: Staff administration page completely broken due to wrong table structure for payment tracking
**Root Cause**: Payment tracking fields stored in daily roster table instead of master staff table. **Correction**: The database schema was correct, but the API endpoint logic was pointing to the wrong table (`staff_roster` instead of `staff`).
**Solution**: Restructure database schema to separate daily operations from long-term staff management. **Correction**: Refactored the `POST /api/admin/staff/:id/payments` endpoint in `backend/routes/admin.js` to correctly use the `staff` table.
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Staff administration payment functionality is now working correctly.

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Add New Staff Failing with Validation Error - âœ… RESOLVED 2024-08-24
**Issue**: The "Add New Staff" feature was failing with a "Masseuse name is required" error.
**Root Cause**: A field name mismatch between the frontend and backend. The frontend was sending `{ "name": "..." }` while the backend was expecting `{ "masseuse_name": "..." }`.
**Solution**: Modified the `POST /api/admin/staff` endpoint in `backend/routes/admin.js` to expect `name`, aligning it with the frontend and improving consistency.
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Staff can now be added successfully through the admin interface.

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Staff Roster Dropdown and Database Permissions Issue âœ… RESOLVED (2025-08-18)
**Issue**: Staff roster dropdown not populating and database permissions causing `SQLITE_READONLY` errors
**Root Cause**: Circular dependency in staff roster design and database file tracked by Git causing permission reversion
**Solution**: Complete staff roster system implementation with database permissions fix
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - Staff roster system is now fully operational with all features working correctly

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Database Schema Mismatch âœ… RESOLVED (2025-08-17)
**Issue**: The `transactions` table schema was missing critical `duration` and `location` columns
**Impact**: All transaction data fails silently while appearing to succeed at API level
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - System cannot function until schema is fixed
**Required Action**: HALT all development, fix database schema, then resume normal operations

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Code Quality and Technical Debt âœ… RESOLVED (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: Codebase contained significant technical debt including 19 critical linting errors, dead code, and unused dependencies
**Root Cause**: Accumulated technical debt from rapid development and multiple bug fixes without proper cleanup
**Solution**: Comprehensive code cleanup session addressing all critical issues
**Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** - All critical linting errors fixed, dead code removed, dependencies optimized, comprehensive documentation created
