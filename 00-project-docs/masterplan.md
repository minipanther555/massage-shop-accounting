- **Testing**: All scripts syntax-validated, logger utility tested, environment configuration working correctly
- **Environment Configuration Bug Fix**: âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed critical bug preventing development mode configuration loading
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for development workflow and testing
- **Root Cause**: Immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) in production config object executed regardless of environment selection
- **Solution**: Moved validation logic to only execute when production config is actually selected, not when it's defined
- **Technical Implementation**: Removed problematic IIFE from productionConfig object definition, moved validation logic to switch statement where production config is selected, added proper session secret validation only when production mode is active
- **Testing**: Development mode loads without errors, production mode validates SESSION_SECRET correctly, server integration working properly

- **Transaction Form Functionality Issues**: âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed critical JavaScript function hoisting and form submission issues
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for business operations and transaction recording
- **Root Cause**: Multiple JavaScript issues including function hoisting problems, variable declaration conflicts, and missing form field names
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive fixes for all identified issues using systematic debugging approach
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Moved all helper functions before `populateDropdowns` to fix function hoisting
  - Changed `paymentSelect` from `const` to `let` for proper variable reassignment
  - Added missing `name` attributes to all required form fields (masseuse, location, service, duration, payment, startTime, endTime)
  - Enhanced logging and debugging throughout the form initialization process
- **Testing**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing confirms transaction form is now fully functional with complete data submission capability
- **Outcome**: Transaction form is now 100% operational and ready for business use

- **Input Validation Middleware Fix**: âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed critical issue preventing transaction form submission
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for business operations and transaction processing
- **Root Cause**: Input validation middleware was validating calculated fields (`payment_amount`, `masseuse_fee`) that should not be validated at middleware level
- **Solution**: Removed validation for calculated fields from the input validation middleware since these are handled by business logic in the transaction route
- **Technical Implementation**: Updated `backend/middleware/input-validation.js` to remove validation for `payment_amount` and `masseuse_fee` fields
- **Testing**: Transaction form submission now works correctly without "Invalid input data" errors
- **Outcome**: Backend no longer rejects valid transaction data, enabling successful form submission

- **Service Dropdown Population Fix**: âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed critical issue preventing service selection in transactions
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for business operations and service selection
- **Root Cause**: Missing `let` declarations in `updateServiceOptions()` and `updateDurationOptions()` functions caused variables to be undefined
- **Solution**: Added proper `let` declarations for `serviceSelect` and `durationSelect` variables in both functions
- **Technical Implementation**: Updated `web-app/transaction.html` to add proper variable declarations in dropdown population functions
- **Testing**: Service dropdown now populates with 18 services for "In-Shop" location, enabling complete transaction workflow
- **Outcome**: Users can now successfully select services and complete transactions, restoring full business functionality

- **Production VPS Deployment**: âœ… COMPLETED - Successfully deployed system to production VPS with full external access
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for business operations and user access
- **Root Cause**: System was only accessible locally, needed production deployment for business use
- **Solution**: Deployed to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS VPS with proper security, Nginx reverse proxy, and external access
- **Technical Implementation**: Set up VPS at 109.123.238.197, configured SSH access with `ssh massage` alias, deployed application with PM2, configured Nginx to serve frontend files and proxy API calls, implemented proper firewall rules
- **Features**: Full external access at http://109.123.238.197, secure SSH access, production monitoring, systemd service management
- **Testing**: External access verified, all pages loading correctly, API endpoints functional, security measures active

- **Nginx Configuration Fix**: âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed routing issues preventing frontend access
- **Priority**: HIGH - Critical for user interface access
- **Root Cause**: Nginx was proxying all requests to backend, but backend had no root route, causing "Route not found" errors
- **Solution**: Configured Nginx to serve frontend files for root path and proxy API calls to backend
- **Technical Implementation**: Updated Nginx configuration to serve static files from `/opt/massage-shop/web-app/` for root path, proxy `/api/` calls to backend, and maintain health check endpoint
- **Testing**: Frontend pages now accessible, API calls working correctly, external access functional

- **Critical Production Issues Resolution**: âœ… RESOLVED - Fixed backend API connectivity and process stability issues
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Blocking all business operations
- **Root Cause**: Multiple configuration issues including wrong database path and port conflicts from stale processes

- **Testing**: All API endpoints now functional, process stable with 25s+ uptime, login system working correctly, external access restored
- **Methodology**: Proven effectiveness of systematic debugging approach using 5-hypothesis testing protocol for complex production issues

- **Critical Authentication System Refactoring**: âœ… COMPLETED - Successfully refactored entire session management system from localStorage to cookie-based
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Was blocking all administrative functions and user authentication
- **Root Cause**: Non-standard session management using localStorage and Authorization headers prevented browser navigation and CSRF token delivery
- **Solution**: Complete refactoring to use standard, secure httpOnly cookies for session management
- **Technical Implementation**: 
  - Installed cookie-parser middleware
  - Refactored login endpoint to set secure session cookies
  - Updated authentication middleware to read from cookies
  - Modified CSRF middleware to work with cookie-based sessions
  - Removed manual Authorization header logic from frontend
  - Fixed CORS configuration for production domain
- **Testing**: Comprehensive functional testing confirms authentication, database connections, API endpoints, and CSRF protection all working correctly
- **Outcome**: System is now fully operational with standard, secure session management
