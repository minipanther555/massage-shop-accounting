# Staff 'Busy Until' Time Reset Issue

## Issue Overview
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for staff scheduling and customer service
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **OPEN** - Needs immediate attention
**Created**: August 18, 2025
**Last Updated**: August 18, 2025

## Problem Description
Staff status shows "busy" perpetually even after the 'busy until' time has passed. This prevents staff from appearing available for new appointments and creates scheduling conflicts.

## Impact
- **Staff Scheduling**: Staff appear unavailable when they should be free
- **Customer Service**: Customers cannot book appointments with staff who appear busy
- **Business Operations**: Reduced booking capacity and potential revenue loss
- **Staff Management**: Difficulty managing staff availability and workload

## Current Behavior
1. Staff is marked as "busy" with a specific end time (e.g., "busy until 2:30 PM")
2. After 2:30 PM passes, staff status remains "busy" instead of resetting to "available"
3. Staff continues to appear unavailable for new appointments indefinitely
4. Manual intervention required to reset staff status

## Expected Behavior
1. Staff is marked as "busy" with a specific end time
2. When current time exceeds the 'busy until' time, status automatically resets to "available"
3. Staff becomes available for new appointments automatically
4. No manual intervention required

## Technical Investigation Needed
1. **Database Schema**: Check if `staff_roster` table has proper timestamp fields for busy status
2. **Backend Logic**: Verify if automatic status reset mechanism exists
3. **Frontend Display**: Check if status display logic is working correctly
4. **Time Zone Handling**: Ensure proper time zone handling for status comparisons

## Potential Solutions
1. **Automatic Status Reset**: Implement cron job or scheduled task to reset expired busy statuses
2. **Real-time Status Check**: Add status validation on each roster access
3. **Database Trigger**: Create database trigger to automatically update status based on time
4. **Frontend Timer**: Implement client-side timer to update status display

## Testing Requirements
1. **Manual Testing**: Mark staff as busy with future time, wait for time to pass, verify status resets
2. **Edge Cases**: Test time zone changes, daylight saving time, midnight rollovers
3. **Performance**: Ensure status reset doesn't impact system performance
4. **Concurrency**: Test multiple staff status changes simultaneously

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Staff status automatically resets to "available" when 'busy until' time passes
- [ ] No manual intervention required for status reset
- [ ] Frontend displays correct current status
- [ ] System performance not impacted by status reset logic
- [ ] All edge cases handled correctly

## Notes
This issue was identified after resolving the critical 500 Internal Server Error. The system is now operational and ready for this enhancement. This is a business-critical feature that affects daily operations and customer service quality.
