# Known Bug: Content Security Policy Violations

## 1. Bug Description
During comprehensive testing, some admin pages were found to have Content Security Policy (CSP) violations related to HTTP URLs that should be HTTPS. This was causing browser security warnings and potential functionality issues.

## 2. Status
- **Date Identified**: 2025-08-16 (during comprehensive functional testing)
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (Security and browser compatibility issue)
- **Impact**: Browser security warnings, potential functionality restrictions, and security policy violations

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
The CSP violations were caused by:
- **HTTP URLs in HTTPS Context**: Some admin pages contained HTTP URLs instead of HTTPS URLs
- **Mixed Content**: The production environment uses HTTPS, but some resources were still referenced with HTTP
- **Security Headers**: CSP headers were correctly configured but content was violating the policy

## 4. Resolution Plan
The solution was to ensure all URLs and resources use HTTPS consistently across the application:

1. **Audit All URLs**: Review all admin pages for HTTP references
2. **Update to HTTPS**: Change all HTTP URLs to HTTPS equivalents
3. **Test CSP Compliance**: Verify that no CSP violations occur after changes
4. **Validate Security**: Ensure all security headers are properly configured

## 5. Resolution Status
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All CSP violations have been resolved
- **Implementation Date**: 2025-08-16
- **Testing Results**: Comprehensive testing confirms no more CSP violations. All admin pages now comply with security policies and load without security warnings.

**Note**: The system now consistently uses HTTPS throughout, ensuring proper security compliance and browser compatibility.
