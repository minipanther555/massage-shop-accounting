# JavaScript Function Hoisting Issues - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
Multiple JavaScript functions in `web-app/transaction.html` were undefined at runtime due to function hoisting problems, causing the transaction form to fail completely.

## Error Details
- **Error Type**: `TypeError: function_name is not defined`
- **Affected Functions**: 
  - `updateTimeDropdowns`
  - `handleSubmit` 
  - `updateServiceOptions`
  - `updateDurationOptions`
  - `updatePricing`
  - `formatTime`
  - `getNextInLineFromStaff`
- **Location**: `web-app/transaction.html` - JavaScript section
- **Impact**: Transaction form completely non-functional

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by **function hoisting problems** where helper functions were being called in the `populateDropdowns` function before their definitions appeared in the script. JavaScript function declarations are hoisted, but function expressions and arrow functions are not.

**Specific Problems:**
1. `getNextInLineFromStaff` was called in `populateDropdowns` before its definition
2. `updateServiceOptions`, `updateDurationOptions`, `updatePricing` were called before definitions
3. `formatTime` function was completely missing
4. `updateTimeDropdowns` and `handleSubmit` were called before definitions

## Solution Applied
**Function Reordering**: Moved all helper functions to appear before `populateDropdowns` in the script:

```javascript
// Helper functions moved to top
function getNextInLineFromStaff(masseuseName) { ... }
function updateServiceOptions() { ... }
function updateDurationOptions() { ... }
function updatePricing() { ... }
function formatTime(time) { ... }
function updateTimeDropdowns() { ... }
function handleSubmit(event) { ... }
// ... other helper functions

// Main function that calls them
function populateDropdowns() { ... }
```

**Additional Fixes:**
1. Added missing `formatTime` function
2. Fixed duplicate variable declarations (`serviceSelect`, `durationSelect`, `paymentSelect`)
3. Completed incomplete `try-catch` block in `populateDropdowns`
4. Removed stray closing braces

## Testing Results
**âœ… RESOLVED:**
- All function hoisting issues fixed
- `updateTimeDropdowns` now defined and accessible
- `handleSubmit` now defined and accessible  
- `updateServiceOptions` now defined and accessible
- `populateDropdowns` executes without function definition errors

**ðŸ”„ REMAINING:**
- Runtime error in `populateDropdowns` during event listener assignment (different issue)

## Files Modified
- `web-app/transaction.html` - Major JavaScript restructuring

## Commits
- `be34e0a` - "Fix function hoisting: move all helper functions before populateDropdowns and restore missing populateDropdowns function"

## Prevention
- Always define helper functions before the main functions that call them
- Use consistent function declaration patterns
- Test JavaScript syntax with `node -c` before deployment
- Maintain clear function dependency hierarchy

## Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The function hoisting issues have been completely resolved. All functions are now properly defined and accessible. The remaining issue is a different type of runtime error unrelated to function definitions.
