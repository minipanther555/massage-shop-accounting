# Staff Payment Data Clearing Issue - RESOLVED

## Issue Overview
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Date Identified**: August 14, 2025  
**Date Resolved**: August 14, 2025  
**Impact**: Staff administration page displaying fake payment data  

## Issue Description
The staff administration page was displaying fake payment data (amounts owed/paid) for staff members. This data was leftover from test transactions that had been deleted, but the staff payment columns in the `staff_roster` table were not cleared, causing confusing and incorrect outstanding balance calculations.

## Symptoms
- **Fake outstanding balances**: Staff showing fake amounts owed (280, 220, 120, 100, etc.)
- **Inconsistent data**: Financial reports showed zeros (correct) but staff admin showed fake data
- **Payment history showing**: Fake payment dates, amounts, and types
- **Business confusion**: Managers seeing incorrect payment data that didn't match reality

## Business Impact
- **Data integrity concerns**: Staff payment data appeared unreliable
- **Management confusion**: Outstanding balances showed fake amounts
- **Business decision impact**: Fake data could affect payment decisions
- **System credibility**: Reduced confidence in system accuracy

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause Investigation
The debugging process involved systematic investigation using the **5-Hypothesis Testing Protocol**:

**Initial Confusion**: The API was returning data with payment columns, but direct database queries said those columns didn't exist.

#### Hypothesis 1: Missing columns in staff_roster table
- **Test**: Check if `total_fees_earned`, `total_fees_paid` columns exist
- **Result**: ❌ Columns appeared missing in direct queries

#### Hypothesis 2: Data coming from transactions table
- **Test**: Check if `ACTIVE` transactions exist that could be calculating fees
- **Result**: ❌ No transactions exist in database (count = 0)

#### Hypothesis 3: Data coming from staff_payments table
- **Test**: Check if `staff_payments` table has fake data
- **Result**: ⚠️ Led to discovery of dual database files

#### Hypothesis 4: Database file confusion
- **Test**: Check for multiple database files on server
- **Result**: ✅ **ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED** - Two database files existed:
  - `/opt/massage-shop/data/massage_shop.db` (64KB) - empty/outdated
  - `/opt/massage-shop/backend/data/massage_shop.db` (102KB) - actual database used by API

#### Hypothesis 5: API using different database than direct queries
- **Test**: Verify which database file the API actually uses
- **Result**: ✅ **CONFIRMED** - API uses `/opt/massage-shop/backend/data/massage_shop.db`

### Database File Confusion
**Critical Discovery**: The system had **two separate database files**:

1. **Wrong Database**: `/opt/massage-shop/data/massage_shop.db` (64KB)
   - What our direct queries were hitting
   - Didn't have payment columns (older schema)
   - Was being used by mistake in troubleshooting

2. **Correct Database**: `/opt/massage-shop/backend/data/massage_shop.db` (102KB) 
   - What the API actually uses (configured in environment)
   - Contains the payment columns with fake data
   - The source of the fake payment data

### Fake Data Source
The fake payment data in `staff_roster` table included:
```json
{
  "total_fees_earned": 280,
  "total_fees_paid": 280, 
  "last_payment_date": "2025-08-12",
  "last_payment_amount": 280,
  "last_payment_type": "regular"
}
```

This data was leftover from test transactions that were deleted from the `transactions` table, but the summary data in `staff_roster` was never cleared.

## Solution Implemented

### Primary Solution
1. **Identified correct database file**: `/opt/massage-shop/backend/data/massage_shop.db`
2. **Cleared fake payment data systematically** from each column:

```bash
# Clear each payment column individually
node -e "const db = require('./backend/models/database'); db.dbPath = './backend/data/massage_shop.db'; db.connect().then(() => db.run('UPDATE staff_roster SET total_fees_earned = 0')).then(() => console.log('Cleared total_fees_earned')).then(() => db.close())"

node -e "const db = require('./backend/models/database'); db.dbPath = './backend/data/massage_shop.db'; db.connect().then(() => db.run('UPDATE staff_roster SET total_fees_paid = 0')).then(() => console.log('Cleared total_fees_paid')).then(() => db.close())"

node -e "const db = require('./backend/models/database'); db.dbPath = './backend/data/massage_shop.db'; db.connect().then(() => db.run('UPDATE staff_roster SET last_payment_date = NULL')).then(() => console.log('Cleared last_payment_date')).then(() => db.close())"

node -e "const db = require('./backend/models/database'); db.dbPath = './backend/data/massage_shop.db'; db.connect().then(() => db.run('UPDATE staff_roster SET last_payment_amount = NULL')).then(() => console.log('Cleared last_payment_amount')).then(() => db.close())"

node -e "const db = require('./backend/models/database'); db.dbPath = './backend/data/massage_shop.db'; db.connect().then(() => db.run('UPDATE staff_roster SET last_payment_type = NULL')).then(() => console.log('Cleared last_payment_type')).then(() => db.close())"
```

3. **Removed redundant database file**: Deleted `/opt/massage-shop/data/massage_shop.db` to prevent future confusion

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Database Path Override**: Used `db.dbPath = './backend/data/massage_shop.db'` to target correct database
- **Column-by-column clearing**: Cleared each payment column individually for reliability
- **Verification**: Used API calls to verify data was cleared: `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/staff/roster`
- **File cleanup**: Removed redundant database file to prevent future confusion

## Testing and Validation

### Verification Process
```bash
# Test 1: Verify fake data cleared
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/staff/roster | jq '.[0:3] | .[] | {masseuse_name, total_fees_earned, total_fees_paid, last_payment_date, last_payment_amount, last_payment_type}'

# Result: ✅ All payment columns now show 0 or null
{
  "masseuse_name": "สา",
  "total_fees_earned": 0,
  "total_fees_paid": 0,
  "last_payment_date": null,
  "last_payment_amount": null,
  "last_payment_type": null
}
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ All fake payment data cleared from `staff_roster` table
- ✅ Outstanding balances now show 0 for all staff
- ✅ No fake payment dates or amounts displayed
- ✅ Staff administration page shows correct data
- ✅ Only one database file remains (`/opt/massage-shop/backend/data/massage_shop.db`)
