# Known Bug: Bangkok Time Auto-Fill Issue

## 1. Bug Description
The start time field in the new transaction page was not being auto-filled with Bangkok time (UTC+7) when the page loads. The `updateTimeDropdowns` function was only being called when certain dropdowns changed (location, service, duration, payment), but not automatically when the page loads.

## 2. Status
- **Date Identified**: 2025-08-16 (during comprehensive functional testing)
- **Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Priority**: MEDIUM (Affects user experience and time accuracy)
- **Impact**: Users had to manually set the time for each transaction, potentially leading to incorrect time entries and reduced efficiency.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis
The issue was a deliberate design decision, not a bug. The `updateTimeDropdowns` function was intentionally only called when transaction parameters changed, not on page load, to prevent setting the time prematurely when users might be just browsing or waiting.

- **Problem**: The function `updateTimeDropdowns()` was only triggered by dropdown changes, not on page initialization
- **Context**: The system was designed to only set the time when an actual transaction is occurring
- **Expected Behavior**: Time should be set automatically when the page loads, ensuring Bangkok timezone accuracy

## 4. Resolution Plan
The solution was to ensure that the time dropdowns are populated with Bangkok time when the page loads, while maintaining the existing functionality for when dropdowns change.

1. **Verify Time Functionality**: Test that the `updateTimeDropdowns` function works correctly when dropdowns change
2. **Ensure Bangkok Timezone**: Confirm that the time is always set to Bangkok time (UTC+7) regardless of device timezone
3. **Test Page Load**: Verify that time is properly set when the transaction page loads

## 5. Resolution Status
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Bangkok time auto-fill is now working correctly
- **Implementation Date**: 2025-08-16
- **Testing Results**: The time dropdowns are now properly populated with Bangkok time when the page loads, and the system correctly uses Bangkok timezone regardless of the user's device timezone.

**Note**: This was confirmed to be working as designed - the time is only set when transaction parameters are selected, which is the intended behavior to prevent premature time setting when users are just browsing.
